# Flights

Create daily flight Parquet files for a date range with:

```bash

For example, create airport-NN flights for March 1 through March 7:

```bash
python -m flights.cli 2026-03-01 2026-03-08 algorithm-nn \
  --adsb-source adsblol
```

The start date is inclusive and the end date is exclusive. Run
